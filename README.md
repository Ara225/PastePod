PastePod will be an open source PasteBin clone built in ASP .NET Core with C#. I'm mainly building this to get some practice with ASP .NET Core and I mainly choose this specific project type because it requires very little frontend/design work

I intend to build this initially as a completely self contained application, and them explore different ways of making it more production ready.

## Planned Features
* Save text documents and share them with anyone with the link anonymously
* Create account and manage pastes 
* Share pastes securely with other people with accounts
* Set expiry dates on pastes
* Syntax highlighting and theme choice in UI
